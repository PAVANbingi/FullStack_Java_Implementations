You're working on a **Todo Management full stack project** with user registration, login, and role-based authorization. Let's break down your project step by step and explain how each part fits into the architecture:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

---

### 1. **User Registration and Login**
   - **Backend**: You will create user registration and login APIs using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security 6**, **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication, and **MySQL** for the database.
     - **Spring Security** will handle authentication and role-based authorization.
     - **JWT** will be used to create secure tokens for user sessions.
   - **Frontend**: You'll create **React.js** forms for the user registration and login pages.
     - **Axios** will be used for making HTTP requests to the backend to register users and log them in.

---

### 2. **Role-Based Authorization**
   - In your application, you'll define two roles:
     - **Admin**: Full access to CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Todo items.
     - **User**: Limited access, such as marking a Todo item as complete or incomplete.
   - **Backend**: 
     - Use **Spring Security 6** to enforce role-based authorization.
     - You can define roles in your database (e.g., `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER`).
     - When a user logs in, the JWT will contain the user's role, and **Spring Security** will check the user's permissions based on the role.
   - **Frontend**:
     - Depending on the logged-in user’s role, you will hide or display certain actions like adding, updating, or deleting Todos. This can be done conditionally in your React components.

---

### 3. **Admin User Actions**
   As an **admin** user, the following actions are available:
   
   **A. Add Todo**
   - **Backend**: 
     - Create an endpoint in **Spring Boot** for adding a new Todo item (e.g., `POST /api/todos`).
     - The Todo will have fields such as `title`, `description`, `completed` (status).
     - Save the Todo item using **Spring Data JPA** (with Hibernate 6).
   - **Frontend**:
     - Create a form using **React** and **Bootstrap** to add a new Todo.
     - When the form is submitted, send a POST request using **Axios** to the backend with the form data.

   **B. Update Todo**
   - **Backend**:
     - Create an endpoint to update a Todo item (e.g., `PUT /api/todos/{id}`).
     - Use **Spring Data JPA** to update the Todo in the database.
   - **Frontend**:
     - In your React app, show an "Update Todo" form.
     - On submission, send a PUT request to the backend to update the Todo.

   **C. Delete Todo**
   - **Backend**: 
     - Create an endpoint to delete a Todo item (e.g., `DELETE /api/todos/{id}`).
   - **Frontend**: 
     - In your React app, show a "Delete" button next to each Todo item.
     - On click, send a DELETE request using **Axios** to remove the Todo.

   **D. Mark Todo as Completed/Incomplete**
   - **Backend**:
     - Create an endpoint to mark a Todo as completed or incomplete (e.g., `PATCH /api/todos/{id}/complete` or `PATCH /api/todos/{id}/incomplete`).
   - **Frontend**:
     - Show buttons to mark a Todo as completed or incomplete.
     - Use **Axios** to send PATCH requests to update the `completed` status.

---

### 4. **User Actions**
   As a **user**, they will have more limited access:
   
   **A. View Todos**
   - **Backend**:
     - Create an endpoint to retrieve the list of Todo items (e.g., `GET /api/todos`).
   - **Frontend**:
     - Use **Axios** to fetch the list of Todos from the backend and display them.

   **B. Mark Todo as Completed/Incomplete**
   - Users will be able to mark Todos as completed or incomplete, just like the admin user.
   - Only the `Complete` and `Incomplete` buttons should be visible to the normal user.

   - You can conditionally render buttons in **React** based on the user's role.

---

### 5. **Logout Functionality**
   - **Backend**:
     - No special endpoint for logout is needed; you just need to invalidate the JWT on the client-side.
   - **Frontend**:
     - When a user clicks the logout button, simply remove the JWT from local storage or cookies.
     - Redirect the user to the login page using **React Router**.

---

### 6. **Testing with Postman**
   - Use **Postman** to test your API endpoints.
     - Start by registering a user via the POST request to `/api/register`.
     - Login with credentials and get a JWT token via POST request to `/api/login`.
     - Use this token in the Authorization header to make requests as a logged-in user.
     - Test all the CRUD operations for both admin and user roles by passing the JWT token.

---

### 7. **Building and Running the Project**
   - **Backend**: Use **Maven** in **IntelliJ IDEA** to manage dependencies and build the Spring Boot project.
     - Ensure your **application.properties** file has the correct **MySQL** configuration for connecting to the database.
   - **Frontend**: Use **Vite** and **npm** for React development. Build the frontend using Vite's build tools, and serve it as a separate front-end app or bundle it with your backend.
   
---

### Final Thoughts:
- The backend will handle the business logic and secure access through Spring Security and JWT.
- The frontend, using React and Bootstrap, will display different features based on the user’s role.
- The project will feature role-based authorization, allowing admin users full control over Todo management while limiting normal users’ actions.

This structure will give you a comprehensive full-stack Todo management system with modern security practices and scalable architecture!
