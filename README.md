## Abstract

### Course Title:
**Fullstack Java Development with Spring Boot and React.js**

### Overview:
This course is designed to provide comprehensive training in building full-stack web applications using modern technologies. Participants will gain hands-on experience in developing robust backend services with Spring Boot and crafting dynamic frontend interfaces with React.js. The curriculum emphasizes project-based learning, ensuring that students can apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.

### Projects:

#### 1. Employer Management Full Stack Project

**Description:**
The Employer Management system is a full-stack web application that facilitates the management of employees and departments within an organization. This project focuses on implementing essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling users to efficiently handle employee data and departmental structures.

**Key Features:**
- **Employee Management Module:**
  - **CRUD Operations:** Add, view, update, and delete employee records.
  - **Department Association:** Assign employees to specific departments, establishing a relational link.
  
- **Department Management Module:**
  - **CRUD Operations:** Add, view, update, and delete department records.
  - **Dependency Handling:** Ensure that employees are associated with existing departments, maintaining data integrity.

**Technologies & Tools:**
- **Backend:**
  - **Spring Boot:** Framework for building scalable and maintainable backend services.
  - **Spring Data JPA & Hibernate:** ORM tools for database interactions with MySQL.
  - **Spring Security & JWT:** Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
  - **MySQL:** Relational database for storing application data.
  - **Maven:** Build automation and dependency management.
  - **Postman:** Testing and validating RESTful APIs.
  - **IntelliJ IDEA:** Integrated development environment for backend development.

- **Frontend:**
  - **React.js:** JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
  - **Bootstrap:** CSS framework for responsive and styled web pages.
  - **Axios:** HTTP client for making API requests.
  - **Visual Studio Code:** Code editor for frontend development.
  - **NPM:** Package manager for JavaScript dependencies.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand the fundamentals of Spring Boot and RESTful API development.
- Implement secure backend services using Spring Security and JWT.
- Design relational database schemas and perform CRUD operations with Spring Data JPA.
- Develop responsive and interactive frontend interfaces with React.js and Bootstrap.
- Integrate frontend and backend components seamlessly using Axios for API communication.
- Utilize tools like Maven and Postman to manage dependencies and test APIs effectively.

#### 2. Todo Management Full Stack Project

**Description:**
The Todo Management application is a comprehensive full-stack project that allows users to register, authenticate, and manage their personal todo lists. This project emphasizes role-based authorization, where admin users can create and assign todos, while regular users can update the status of these tasks.

**Key Features:**
- **User Registration & Authentication:**
  - **Registration Form:** Allows new users to sign up for the application.
  - **Login Functionality:** Enables users to access the application using registered credentials.
  
- **Todo Management Module:**
  - **Admin Capabilities:** Create, view, update, and delete todo items.
  - **User Capabilities:** Mark todos as complete or incomplete based on assigned tasks.
  - **Role-Based Authorization:** Differentiates access levels between admin and regular users to ensure secure operations.

**Technologies & Tools:**
- **Backend:**
  - **Spring Boot:** Core framework for backend service development.
  - **Spring Data JPA & Hibernate:** Managing database interactions with MySQL.
  - **Spring Security & JWT:** Securing the application with token-based authentication.
  - **MySQL:** Database management system for persisting application data.
  - **Maven:** Managing project dependencies and builds.
  - **Postman:** API testing and validation.
  - **IntelliJ IDEA:** Development environment for backend services.

- **Frontend:**
  - **React.js:** Building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
  - **Bootstrap:** Styling the application for a professional look and feel.
  - **Axios:** Facilitating communication between frontend and backend via HTTP requests.
  - **Visual Studio Code:** Development environment for frontend coding.
  - **NPM:** Managing JavaScript packages and dependencies.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Develop user authentication and authorization mechanisms using Spring Security and JWT.
- Implement role-based access control to differentiate functionalities between admin and regular users.
- Create interactive frontend components with React.js to handle user interactions and data display.
- Manage application state and handle asynchronous API calls using Axios.
- Ensure data consistency and integrity through effective database design and ORM practices.
- Apply best practices in full-stack development to build secure and maintainable web applications.

### Conclusion:
Through the development of the Employer Management and Todo Management full-stack projects, participants will acquire a deep understanding of both backend and frontend technologies. The course emphasizes practical application, preparing students to build scalable, secure, and user-friendly web applications in real-world environments.
